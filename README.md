# NLP_spelling_correction

 This repository contains my solution for the task of **context sensitive spelling correction**.

The solution is based on Norvig's idea that has been improved by using bigrams instead of unigrams with the addition of Laplase smoothing.

The results are described in the notebook `Assignment1.ipynb` and datasets are also provided in the repository.
